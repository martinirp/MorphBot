# Git ignore guide

This short README explains the project's `.gitignore` entries and gives quick commands to inspect ignored files.

**Why we ignore these files**

- `node_modules/` — dependencies installed locally; do not commit (large + platform-specific).
- `music_cache_opus/`, `temp_downloads/` — audio caches and temporary downloads; regenerated by the bot.
- `utils/music.db` and other DB artifacts (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `*.db-wal`, `*.db-shm`) — local sqlite databases; may contain private info and are environment-specific.
- `.env`, `.env.*` — environment variables and secrets (tokens, keys). Never commit.
- `*.log`, `npm-debug.log*`, `yarn-error.log*` — logs and debug output.
- `.vscode/`, `*~`, `*.swp` — editor/IDE settings and temp files.
- `dist/`, `build/` — build outputs.
- OS files: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db` — system-generated files.

These entries reduce noise in the repo and protect secrets and large binary artifacts.

**Commands you can run locally**

Open PowerShell in the project root and run:

```powershell
# show ignored files (compact list)
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard

# show why a file is ignored
git check-ignore -v path\to\file

# list ignored status including tracked files
git status --ignored
```

**If you accidentally committed a secret or DB**

1. Remove it from the index and commit the removal:

```powershell
git rm --cached path/to/file
git commit -m "remove sensitive file"
```

2. To purge from history use a tool like BFG or git filter-repo (careful — rewriting history affects collaborators).

**If you intentionally want to keep a file that is ignored**

- Force add it (usually not recommended):

```powershell
git add -f path/to/file
git commit -m "add forced file"
```

**Notes & suggestions**

- Keep `.env` out of the repository; use a sample file like `.env.example` (without secrets) if you want to document required env vars.
- If you want, I can add a `.env.example` with the expected variables and a short `docs/DEPLOY.md` describing install and runtime requirements (ffmpeg, yt-dlp, node version, etc.).

If you want I can also run `git status --ignored` here for you, but I don't have access to your local git environment — run the commands above in your terminal and paste the output if you want help interpreting it.
